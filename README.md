# Blood-Prediction-Experiment

# Description:
Machine Learning is not only successful in business but also helping the healthcare industry and revolutionizing it. Here, we are presenting a very simple machine learning model to predict that during an ask to donate blood who will respond positively and will donate blood.

# DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Create Project/Experiment and import movie rating data set from saved dataset samples. After creating experiment, we need to drag and drop the required modules in canvas.

I have used the below modules for my experiment in the given order

DATA SET:
 
   Data set required for experiment is added
   
Blood Donation :
 
   This data set consists of blood banks and blood donors.
   
 Editing Metadata:
 
   Used to change data type of fields, etc.
   
 Join data:
 
   Used to join the above two dataset.
   
 Select column in dataset:
 
   Select columns to inclue or exclude from a dataset in an operation.formerly known as project columns.
   
 Remove duplicate rows:
 
   Remove the duplicate rows from a dataset.
   
 Split data:
 
   split the rows of a dataset into two distinct areas,here the dataset is splitted into Train and Score matchbox recommender.
   
 Train matchbox recommender:
 
   Train a bayesian recommender using the matchbox algorithm.
   
 Score matchbox recommender:
 
   It scores a dataset using matchbox recommender.
   
 Evaluate recommender:
 
   this is the final dataset it evaluates and gives the accuracy values 
   this evaluate recommender is used to evaluates a recommender model.
After creating, run the model by clicking run button in the bottom side. After running successfully, we can score and evaluate the model.

# Deploying the model:
Deploy the model by Setting up Web Service in ML Studio. For first time select Update Predictive Experiment. after deployment of model, it can be used in webs.

Web Service Consumption options:

     Excel 2010 or earlier
     Request-Response Web App Template
